### Abstract

In this thesis, I critically examine how institutional corruption, operationalised through epistemic clientelism and fiduciary opacity, systematically compromises journalism covering UK higher education (HE). Drawing explicitly on my previously developed theoretical frameworks—_Epistemic Clientelism Theory_ (Kahl 2025), _fiduciary epistemology_, and _constitutional critiques of media institutions as epistemic gatekeepers_ (‘Epistemic Gatekeepers as the Fourth Estate’, Kahl 2025)—and integrating Lawrence Lessig’s theory of institutional corruption and Brian Klaas’s analysis of elite power dynamics, I demonstrate that prominent UK media organisations (notably Times Higher Education and The Guardian) have become structurally dependent upon elite institutional and commercial interests. Through rigorous empirical analysis, detailed case studies (e.g., Anna Fazackerley’s affiliations with Policy Exchange, THE’s commercial relationships), and sociological network mapping, I expose how entrenched networks of privilege, financial dependencies, and reciprocal professional alignments among journalists, higher education institutions, and policy elites systematically erode democratic accountability, epistemic fairness, and public trust.

Further, this research situates journalism within broader elite trajectories connecting privileged education (notably Oxbridge), influential journalistic roles, and subsequent political power—highlighting structural vulnerabilities enabling epistemic control, narrative conformity, and fiduciary breaches. To address these vulnerabilities, I propose robust fiduciary reforms including structurally independent fiduciary journalists, mandatory conflict-of-interest disclosures, a formal Journalistic Hippocratic Oath, fiduciary oversight boards, regular fiduciary audits, and strengthened legislative oversight. Ultimately, this thesis articulates and defends my original theoretical model—_The Theory of Institutional Corruption through Epistemic Clientelism and Fiduciary Opacity_—clarifying the entrenched elite power dynamics underpinning contemporary journalism and democratic governance. The theory thus provides an essential theoretical foundation and practical blueprint for restoring integrity, transparency, and democratic legitimacy within journalism covering UK higher education.
